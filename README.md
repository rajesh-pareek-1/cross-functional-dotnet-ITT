# Cross-Functional Learning Plan (March - April 2025)

## Overview
This repository tracks my cross-functional learning journey as I transition from React Native to .NET backend development. Each week, a new branch (e.g., `week1`, `week2`) will contain plans, progress updates, and code exercises.

### Week 5: Dependency Injection (DI) and Best Practices (March 29 - April 4)
**Goal:** Implement DI and follow best coding practices.

**Resources:**
- [Dependency Injection in .NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection)

**Topics:**
- DI setup in ASP.NET Core
- Singleton, Scoped, and Transient lifetimes
- Basic design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Repository)

**Practice:**
- Refactor the API project to use DI and apply design patterns.

---

### Week 6: Asynchronous Programming & Testing (April 5 - April 11)
**Goal:** Learn async programming and testing in .NET.

**Resources:**
- [Asynchronous Programming in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/)
- [xUnit Documentation](https://xunit.net/)

**Topics:**
- Async/await and parallel processing
- Writing unit tests using xUnit
- Mocking with Moq (optional)

**Practice:**
- Implement async methods and test them using unit tests.

---

### Week 7: Advanced Topics and Deployment (April 12 - April 18)
**Goal:** Gain hands-on experience with deployment, Docker, and CI/CD.

**Resources:**
- [Dockerizing .NET Apps](https://docs.docker.com/samples/dotnet/)
- [CI/CD with Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/)

**Topics:**
- Dockerizing a .NET application
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline

**Practice:**
- Containerize the task manager API and deploy it using Docker.

---

### Week 8: Full Project Development & Review (April 19 - April 26)
**Goal:** Apply all learned concepts in a full-stack .NET project.

**Practice:**
Develop a complete .NET application (e.g., a to-do list, blog, or simple e-commerce API) implementing:
- CRUD operations
- EF Core for database management
- Dependency Injection
- Asynchronous methods
- Unit tests for core functionality

---

## Contribution Guidelines
1. Each week's progress will be tracked in a separate branch (e.g., `week1`, `week2`).
2. Pull requests will be created for review before merging changes into the main branch.
3. Weekly retrospectives will be documented to track learning and improvements.

## Contact
For suggestions or discussions, feel free to open an issue or reach out.

This plan allows me to systematically upskill in backend technologies while continuing my contributions as a React Native developer. Looking forward to this learning journey!
